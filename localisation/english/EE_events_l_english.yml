Recent events have raised concerns within the ranks of the Gestapo  regarding the unquestionable loyalty of certain members of the SS.\n\nWhile the SS has long been regarded as a bastion of loyalty and devotion to the ideals of the National Socialist movement, disturbing reports  have surfaced suggesting that elements within its ranks may be harboring doubts or entertaining thoughts contrary to the principles upon which our great nation stands.\n\nAs custodians of the regime's security and  integrity, it is our solemn responsibility to bring such matters to your attention. The implications of disloyalty within the SS are grave, potentially undermining the very foundation upon which our movement is  built.\n\nWe urge you, esteemed leader, to consider these reports with the gravity they deserve and take appropriate measures to ensure the unwavering loyalty and commitment of the SS to your person and to the  ideals of National Socialism.\n\nRest assured, the Gestapo remains vigilant in our efforts to safeguard the integrity of the state and will spare no effort in rooting out any threats to its stability and security. \n\nHeil Hitler!"

 germany.turmoil.1.d:0 "As Hitler's New Years Speech was ongoing, the hearts of the people turned red as they were filled with excitement for the plans of Germany, however the German Communists did not like this.

Göring is among the top officials of Hitler’s former Inner-circle. While not very well liked among much of the military cadres he is at least respected as an old war hero and vocal defender of the German aristocracy and its privileges. If Hess and the German Volk were to support anyone it would inevitably be Göring."

Over the past eight years, Himmler has developed the SS from a 290-man police force into a 500,000-strong paramilitary group. Now, with the death of Hitler, there is little to stop Himmler's growing interest in occultism and Völkisch topics. And yet, Himmler is not a man who is merely lost in the ideas of Godhood; he is also known for his organizational skills and for selecting only the best when it comes to competent subordinates. Overseeing all internal and external forces of the Reich, nothing is out of his sight. With the support of his followers growing and his influence stronger than ever, even those such as Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess have little to no choice but to choose Himmler as the Future Führer of Germany. After all, the best political weapon is the weapon of terror."
